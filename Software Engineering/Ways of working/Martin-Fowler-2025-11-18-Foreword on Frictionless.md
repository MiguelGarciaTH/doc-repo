# My Foreword to “Frictionless”

**Source:** [Martin Fowler – My Foreword to “Frictionless”](https://martinfowler.com/articles/frictionless-foreword.html)

I haven't read the book Frictionless by Nicole and Abi, but the foreword by Martin Fowler (the father of Refactoring) is very simple yet full of wisdom. 

> Almost every engineering manager I've met wants to make their team more productive, but almost every developer I've met wants to be more effective at what they do. But lunches like that easily lead developers to the cynicism that talking about productivity is about making simplistic measurements which forget the invincible power of Goodhart's Law: “When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure”.

Software development productivity should be measured by friction, considering three main elements: feedback loops, flow state, and cognitive load. 

Rapid feedback loops are the best indicators of how close we are to the right path. They help maintain the momentum for fast and accurate improvements (flow state). Finally, keeping cognitive load low lets us focus on the right issues in a timely manner. 

Happy (motivated!) developers lead to better code, better decisions, and more ownership, which inevitably leads to better outcomes. Developers are expensive, so ensure you use their time wisely. Software that is not in production is a revenue loss. Software that is not adopted is a revenue loss. Software that is not well-made but shipped quickly to meet some company target is a revenue loss.


Fowler's preferred quote on productivity measurements:
Goodhart's Law: “When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure”.

Fowler quoted a new favorite of his: 
    "An incomplete measurement is better than no measurement, if you treat it as a clue instead of judgment." by Jessica Kerr
