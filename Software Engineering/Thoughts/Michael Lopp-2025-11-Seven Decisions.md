    1. Vanilla. Someone decided. Good. No further questions. We can make progress now.
    2. Educated. You ask why they decided, and they can clearly explain their reasoning. Not everyone might appreciate the decision, but they will be given the opportunity to understand.1
    3. Calculated. Not only can they explain the decision, but they have math! Wow, I’m super convinced now.
    4. Instinct. They attempt to explain their reasoning, but they say “feel” a lot. A lot. Thing is, it feels right, so you don’t press.
    5. Inspired. Now you press, and they can tell you want a clear rationale and justification, but none obviously exists. This decision is not meant to be understood; it’s meant to be appreciated for its poetry. It is 100% expected that inspired decisions are going to frustrate those seeking clarity; they are going to point at the lack of a clear explanation. “He doesn’t know what the hell he’s doing. It’s a guess.” It might be a guess, but it also might be art in the making.2 3
    6. Minimum Viable. My least favorite. Your investigation into their justification reveals that they chose a decision that was not designed to be good; it was constructed to offend the fewest humans. This is not leadership — it’s fear.
    7. Delegated. Rather than doing the minimal work of even making a minimum viable decision, they gave the decision to someone else because — and I quote — “They are more capable of making this decision.” What they are actually saying is, “I would prefer that this human deal with the weight and consequences for this decision.” The good news: at least you got a decision.


💡 In this post on Rands in Repose, Michael Lopp describes seven types of decisions: Vanilla, Educated, Calculated, Instinct, Inspired, Minimum Viable, and Delegated.

They are not sorted on a scale, however, I can sort them somehow.

🟢 In what I consider the most productive, transparent, and rational are Educated and Calculated ones. They are less dogmatic and attempt to involve everyone—if not in the decision, at least in understanding it. Although not mentioned in the post, these seem easier to reopen for discussion.

🔴 Then we have the worst ones: On one side, we have Vanilla—which is likely perceived as authoritarian. On the other side, we have Minimum Viable, which, as I quote, "was constructed to offend the fewest humans."

🟡 Then we have the Inspired and Instinct types, which seem a bit dogmatic and potentially dangerous.

🟠 Finally, Delegated, which seems an open door to any of the other bad decision types.
